1. **What is HTML?**  
HTML is like the skeleton of a webpage. It’s code that structures content (text, images, etc.) using tags. Think of it as the blueprint browsers use to display stuff.  

2. **Minimal HTML5 structure:**  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
```  
Just 5 tags: doctype, html, head (with charset and title), and body.

3. **Purpose of the meta tag?**  
Meta tags give behind-the-scenes info, like setting the character set (e.g., UTF-8 for emojis 🌟), telling search engines what your page is about, or controlling how it looks on mobile.

4. **‹head› vs ‹header›?**  
`<head>` is for invisible stuff like titles and meta tags. `<header>` is a visible section at the top of your page, like a logo/menu bar. Totally different!

5. **What’s a `<form>` tag for?**  
Forms let users interact: logins, search bars, surveys. They collect data (like text inputs, checkboxes) and send it to a server when submitted.

6. **Explain the code:**  
This creates a link to "example.com/sample_page". The `rel="noreferrer nofollow"` tells search engines: “Don’t boost that site’s SEO because of this link, and hide where the traffic came from.” Often used for untrusted links.

7. **Multiple languages?**  
Add `lang="es"` (for Spanish) in the `<html>` tag. Use a meta tag like `<meta http-equiv="Content-Language" content="fr">` for French. For dynamic content, pair this with server-side language-switching or translation files.

8. **Semantic HTML tags?**  
Tags like `<nav>`, `<article>`, or `<footer>` that describe *what* the content is (not just how it looks). Helps screen readers, SEO, and makes code easier to understand. Better than a million generic `<div>`s!
